## About Stock Overflow

Stock Overflow is a portfolio management app that allows users to create custom watchlists for stocks and manage their stock trades. When you create a new account, your account is defaulted with a 'main' dashboard that contains the summaries of your other stock watchlists.

This app was inspired by the Bloomberg Terminal dashboard.
